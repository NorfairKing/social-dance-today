A dance floor provides the perfect dance floor. In the Zeughausareal we are outside, but have a roof where we are protected from short rain showers.\r\n\r\nIf the weather forecast calls for heavy rain or thunderstorms, we have an alternative room indoors, also in the Zeughaus area.\r\n\r\nBefore the event, there will be a crash course for beginners at 18.00-18.30, which you can also attend without a dance partner.\r\n\r\nENTRANCE FEE\r\nAdmission is free for all. We have a donation box where you can support the association.\r\n\r\nCOVID\r\nA Covid certificate is compulsory to attend the event. Visitors from EU countries also need an EU Covid certificate.\r\n\r\nYou don't have a certificate and want to get one with as little effort as possible?\r\n\r\nThe event will definitely take place. So it's best to make an appointment for a test well in advance, and it's easiest to visit the test centre before the event and ask for a Covid certificate. The test takes about 15 minutes and is free of charge. After the test, the certificate should already be delivered on the way to the Openair Salsa.\r\n\r\nTest dates Uster:\r\nhttps://www.spitaluster.ch/de/Ueber-uns/Covid-19/Covid-19-Tests.830.html\r\n\r\nIf no more appointments can be booked in Uster before the event, the Kasernenareal Zurich has a lot of capacity and also spontaneously still has test appointments available:\r\n\r\nTest dates Zurich Kasernenareal:\r\nhttps://www.stadt-zuerich.ch/triemli/de/index/service/medien/auszeichnungen-news/covid-testcenter/corona-testcenter.html\r\n\r\nIt is best to optimise the route so that the test centre is on the way.\r\n\r\n \r\nQuestions or doubts?\r\nWrite to us at info@salsaon2happenings.ch!\r\n\r\nhttp:/salsaon2.ch"}
