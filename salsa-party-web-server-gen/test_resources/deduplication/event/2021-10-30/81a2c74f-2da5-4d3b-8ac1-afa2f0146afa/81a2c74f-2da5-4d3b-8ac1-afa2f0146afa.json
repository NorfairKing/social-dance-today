So there will be a little foretaste of the marathon ambience in June.\r\n \r\nSamuel and Lisa from Freiburg will give us another great show. They are also on a workshop tour in Zurich this weekend.\r\n \r\n \r\nOn the Friday before the event, there will also be a coordinated mambo event in Wohlen (SalsaOlé).\r\n \r\nFor dancers who need to be tested for a Covid certificate, only one test is necessary for both events (certificate must be valid on both dates).\r\n\r\n \r\nPure social dancing to the best old school Salsa, Cha-Cha-Cha and Boogaloo in a classy ambience.\r\n\r\nAdmission: CHF 26.-\r\nTickets: https://eventfrog.ch/de/p/party/latin-brasil/mambo-time-chocolate-edition-6850490217703912626.html\r\n\r\nAt the Hotel Restaurant Landhus, Katzenbachstrasse 10, Zurich Seebach (terminus Tram 14)\r\n\r\nhttp://salsaon2.ch"}
