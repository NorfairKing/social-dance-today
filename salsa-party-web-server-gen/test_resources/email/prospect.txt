Dear Salsarica

We hope this message finds you well.
We wanted to reach out and invite you to advertise your parties on our website, https://social-dance.today/, for free!

As fellow social dancers, we understand the importance of having a go-to resource for finding dance events.
That's why we created Social Dance Today, a search engine for parties all over the world.
In fact, some of your events, such as "FridayNight@Bananenreiferei" (https://social-dance.today/party/FridayNight@Bananenreiferei/2022-12-23), are already advertised on our site.

Over the past three months, we've had 550 active users from ZÃ¼rich alone, with a total of over 8000 users worldwide.
We believe that by becoming an organizer on our site, you could benefit from an increase in attendance at your parties.
Plus, it's free to join!

There are several advantages to submitting your events directly on our site:

- Your parties will be prioritized in search results.
- You'll have your own organizer page, where dancers can see all of your upcoming parties.
  You can check out the organizer page for SalsaOn2Happenings (https://social-dance.today/organiser/salsaon2happenings) as an example.
- You'll have a calendar URL that people can use to automatically add your current and future events to their calendars.
  For example, you can try adding the calendar URL for SalsaOn2Happenings to your calendar to see how it works: https://social-dance.today/organiser/salsaon2happenings/calendar.ics
- You can create recurring events that will automatically appear on schedule.
- Our site will link to yours, which is great for your site's search engine optimization (SEO).


We hope that you'll consider joining us as an organizer on https://social-dance.today/.
We look forward to your reply.

Best regards,
Social Dance Today
