Hello #{prospectEmailName prospectEmail}

We would like to invite you to advertise your parties on @{HomeR}, for free!

We are fellow social dancers and we have developed a website where
dancers can find where they can go dance: @{HomeR}.

We are glad that you organise parties for people to enjoy.
Some of your events, "#{externalEventTitle $ prospectEmailExternalEvent prospectEmail}" for example
(@{externalEventRoute $ prospectEmailExternalEvent prospectEmail}),
are already advertised on our site because our site acts as a search
engine for parties across the internet as well.

In the past three months, we have had 550 active users from Zürich.
If you think your parties could benefit from more attendants, we can
recommend you to become an organiser on our site for free.

There are several advantages to submitting your events directly on our
site:

- Your parties get prioritised in the search result pages.
- You get an organiser page where dancers can see all your upcoming parties.
  See the organiser page of #{exampleOrganiser} (@{OrganiserSlugR exampleOrganiserSlug}) for an example.
- You get a calendar URL that people can use to add your current and
  future events to their calendars automatically.
  You can try adding the calendar URL of #{exampleOrganiser} to your
  calendar to see what that looks like:
  @{OrganiserSlugCalendarR exampleOrganiserSlug}
- You can make recurring events once and have them appear on schedule.
- Our site will link to yours, which is great for your site's search engine optimisation (SEO).


We look forward to your reply.

Kind regards
Social Dance Today
